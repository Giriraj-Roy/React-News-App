# React-News-App

A news API has been integrated here using __axios__ and respective cards with details of the news have been shown.
This project is more of a learning curve for react and its basic utilisations.
Implemented React Hooks through Functional Components which is better than using Class Components.

Using Semantic UI just to make things readable.
